This contains a test suite written using the old query model, together
with a copy of that query model (forever frozen in time) and some
functions which convert the test cases into the new query model. It's
useful to have around while we work on refactoring the query engine.

Once we have sufficient new-style tests in place we can just delete this
directory.
